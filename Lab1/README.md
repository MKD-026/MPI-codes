### Program 1 : int_representation.c :

In this program, the integer value can be representated as 32-bit or 64-bit. The varible, `bits` can be set to 32 or 64 depending on the number of bits to be displayed.

### Program 2 : float_representation.c :

This program represents the IEEE format of storing floating point number. It consists of a union data structure storing floating point number. The union is further divided into sign, mantissa and exponent. The size of exponent, and mantissa control the representation of floating point number.

### Program 3 : double_representation.c :

This program represents the IEEE format of storing double point number. It consists of a union data structure storing double point number. The union is further divided into sign, mantissa and exponent. The size of exponent, and mantissa control the representation of floating point number. Here, the bit size changes from 32-bit to 64-bit, so, the difference lies in the bit size of exponent (11) and mantissa (52).
