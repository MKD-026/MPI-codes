# MPI Lab Assignment 6

This repo contains solutions to the 2 given questions, just run the commands from rootdir to compile and get results. (Scripts only for X86_64)

### Program 1 : Matrix addition:

In this program, we take the user input 'n' for the n*n matrix. The user inputs the values for matrix A and matrix B. The two matrices A and B along with the value of n are sent to the 'matadd' function. The matadd function adds the values of every element in each matrix.
Example: If the user inputs n=3, then two matrices of 3*3 are created. Then, the user inputs the values for the matrices A and B. The result is stored in matrix A.

  ```bash
  cd 1
  bash compile.sh
  ```

### Program 2 : Matrix multiplication:

In this program, we take the user input 'n' for the n*n matrix. The user inputs the values for matrix A and matrix B. Three matrices A, B and C along with the value of n are sent to the 'multiply' function. The matadd function adds the values of every element in each matrix.
Example: If the user inputs n=3, then three matrices of 3*3 are created. Then, the user inputs the values for the matrices A and B. The result is stored in matrix C.

  ```bash
  cd 2
  bash compile.sh
  ```
